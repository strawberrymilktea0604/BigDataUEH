Hundreds of thousands of vehicles recorded for traffic violations in Ho Chi Minh City have been “shamed” but their owners still refuse to pay fines.
On the electronic information portal of the Ho Chi Minh City Police (HCMC Police), in the section listing vehicles that committed administrative violations captured by images (from January 4, 2017, to January 4, 2018), there are records of license plate numbers, violation types, and violation dates for 34,118 vehicles (cars) that have not yet paid fines.
These are vehicles whose violations were recorded by mobile or fixed cameras of the HCMC Police (so-called “photo fines”). It is noteworthy that, although the Road Traffic Police Department (PC67) of HCMC Police has sent violation notices to local police posts several times, the owners or drivers of these vehicles still have not complied with the administrative penalty decisions.
The most common offense is parking in unauthorized areas. For example, from January to July 2017, the car with plate number 14A-130... was recorded 23 times for parking in prohibited areas on Hàm Nghi Street, District 1; from March to October 2017, the car with plate number 30S-087... was recorded 34 times for parking on Nguyễn Cư Trinh Street, District 1; from April to October 2017, the car with plate number 86B-0066... was recorded 34 times for parking on Nguyễn Cư Trinh Street, District 1; from May to December 2017, the car with plate number 86B-0074... was recorded 27 times for parking on Nguyễn Cư Trinh Street, District 1; from April to October 2017, the car with plate number 84B-0023... was recorded 9 times for parking on Trần Phú Street, District 5... Since early 2017 until now, PC67 has repeatedly sent violation notices and even “shamed” these vehicles on the HCMC Police’s electronic portal, yet they continue to re-offend.
Stronger Measures Needed
According to Lieutenant Colonel Phạm Công Danh, Head of the Traffic Command and Signal Control Team (PC67), once the violation procedures are complete, the Traffic Police will print a violation notice with full details and send it to the ward, commune, or township police; for vehicles registered in other provinces or cities, the notice is sent by post. The local police will then forward the violation notice to the vehicle owner and invite the owner to come to the PC67 office (52–54 Nguyễn Khắc Nhu, Cô Giang Ward, District 1) to resolve the case.
Capturing Images of Parking Violations in the City Center
However, the enforcement of fine collection remains ineffective and insufficient as a deterrent. From 2017 to now, PC67 has extracted 49,704 violation cases but has only fined 16,106 cases (a rate of 32.4%). This coercive fine collection has not been effective.
Explaining this situation, Senior Lieutenant Colonel Phạm Công Danh acknowledged that offenders do not pay fines because: vehicle owners buy or sell without transferring registration, so the violation notices do not promptly reach the actual owners; owners frequently change addresses; companies dissolve; vehicle owners may have died or emigrated; or owners deliberately evade compliance.
According to a precinct police chief of the HCMC Police, when the local traffic police deliver a violation notice, if the address does not match any resident, they return it to PC67. The precinct police do not have time to investigate further. Only when there is a request from prosecuting agencies will the precinct pursue the matter exhaustively.
It can be seen that the main reason remains that local police forces are not determined to see the matter through. Under current regulations, if the police fully fulfill their responsibilities, they should readily find the vehicle’s owner or driver. When citizens wish to transfer their household registration to another location, they go to the ward or district office to request a change form, which clearly states the old and new addresses; then they submit it to the district to cancel registration at the old address and register at the new one. If, after moving, they do not formally transfer their household registration but instead only register temporary residence or temporary absence, within 12 months, if they meet the conditions for permanent registration and still do not register, they will be fined, said a leader of the Administrative Management of Social Order Police Department (PC64), HCMC Police.
To Improve Fine Collection Enforcement
To enhance the effectiveness of coercive fine collection, Lieutenant Colonel Nguyễn Văn Bình, Head of the PC67 Planning Team, confirmed: In the coming time, for vehicles of transport companies, PC67 will invite the companies to receive violation notices, require them to hand the notices directly to the offending drivers, and hold the companies responsible for urging their drivers to pay the fines.
Moreover, PC67 patrols and inspections will coordinate to check directly on the computer database; once they detect a vehicle violation captured by images for which a notice has already been sent but the fine has not been paid, the monitoring team will inform the patrol unit to stop the vehicle, inspect it, and issue a report demanding that the vehicle owner come to the Traffic Police office to resolve the case.
